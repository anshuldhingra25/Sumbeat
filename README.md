# Android Kotlin MVVM Example

## Initial Setup
This example app consumes the [BandsInTown API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0)

An API key is provided, but it is recommended to use a developer's key. Once an API key is obtained via logging into SwaggerHub then visiting Profile -> Settings -> API keys, place the key under /Users/<username>/.gradle/gradle.properties as `AndroidBaseKotlinMVVM_BandsInTownApiKey="<key>"` or in the project's gradle.properties
